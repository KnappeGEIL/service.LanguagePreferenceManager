# A manager for audio and subtitle preferences

This addon provides an easy way to set audio stream and subtitle language in Kodi Matrix.

It's now also possible to set a keyword blacklist for conditional subtitles.

For example, most dual audio Anime provides english and japanese audio and two english subtitles. Dialogue subtitles with all the dialogue to go with the japanese audio and Song/Sign subtitles which only translate song lyrics and signs you see on screen to be used with the english audio stream. Previously the addon just picked the first subtitles with the correct language which weren't always the correct ones.

It's now possible to configure a comma-seperated keyword list as a blacklist for conditional subtitles. If a subtitle name contains one or more of these keywords the subtitles will be ignored.

## Example of keyword blacklist
